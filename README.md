# ES6 + JSPM + Gulp Starter

Starter template for developing ES6+ apps using JSPM & Gulp. This is heavily
geared toward single page applications ("SPA"), but can be modified for use for
a regular website as well.

## Primary Technologies

* Transpiles ES6+ automagically using [Babel][]
* Package management using [JSPM][]
* Develop and build using [Gulp][] and friends

## Starter Features

* Uses JSPM instead of Bower or npm to manage packages for the browser
* Uses [SystemJS][] to load modules via JSPM
* Sass compilation using [LibSass][] and [Autoprefixer][]
* Local dev server with [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) using
    [Browsersync][]
* Define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors using
    [EditorConfig][]
* Linting with [ESLint][]
* Gulp tasks are written using ES6, of course.
* Build task deals with simple case of fonts, images, and CSS url references
    properly.
* [Unlicensed][]

3. Install Gulp globally: `npm install -g gulp`.
